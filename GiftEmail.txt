Season's Greetings!

You, and {0} others, have chosen to participate in the Christmas Gift Exchange this year!

Here's how it works:
	* Each participant has written down around 3 ideas for what they'd like to receive for Christmas.
	* In some cases these are specific items on Amazon or elsewhere, and in other cases they are general.
	* You will receive a list of your assigned recipient and you'll pick which of the 3 gifts you like the most, and purchase it for them.
	* Your assignment is anonymous and no one knows who you have, but feel free to provide a card or a note identifying yourself once the presents are unwrapped!

Oh, and the rule is that the items should be in the $20 range.  Let us know if anyone is asking for something way outside the price range!

This year, you have been matched with...

I'm sure they will be 100% in love with any of the above gift ideas - after all, the ideas are from them!  But shh - you didn't hear that from me.

Please remember to go shopping and wrap up your present before we meet on Some Date at Some Location!

If anyone has questions please let us know!
